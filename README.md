Heatapp API for Ruby
====================

[Heatapp](https://heatapp.de) is a system to control your heating system at home.

It can control radiators and floor heating, measuring room temperature, and working on a defined schedule and choosen
temperatures. 

The module is still under heavy development!

I want to make it easy to access environment data.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'heatapp'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install heatapp

## Usage
